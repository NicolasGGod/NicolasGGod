Back in 2019, I happened to discover the existence of  the [Harvard Data Science Review](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/), just as its first issue launched.

More than a year later, I find myself going back there quite often to follow the broad trends of the field, but also just to enjoy a good scientific read.

While there are a few more technically-oriented articles in there, my favourite pieces are the well-written, strongly documented and peer-reviewed articles about high level topics and challenges around data science. In the best cases, the articles strike a perfect compromise, like expertly written blog posts backed with all the rigour of academic publications.

I'd recommend any data science enthusiast to have at least quick look around. If you're not sure where to start, try the editorials that also serve as summaries, or if you prefer to live dangerously, here are my top picks from each of the first 6 issues.

### [Artificial Intelligence—The Revolution Hasn’t Happened Yet](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/wot7mkc1/release/8)

A thought-provoking editorial about the long road ahead to reach a true AI revolution, by the immense Michael I. Jordan (the one who's good at everything *but* basketball, according to some sources). This article previously appeared on Medium, but the version here is enhanced with a large number of sources, as well as many discussion pieces and a rejoinder.

> Let’s broaden our scope, tone down the hype, and recognize the serious challenges ahead.

###### Runner-up

[(A) Data in the Life: Authorship Attribution in Lennon-McCartney Songs](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/xcq8a1v1/release/5)

### [Why Are We Using Black Box Models in AI When We Don’t Need To? A Lesson From An Explainable AI Competition](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/f9kuryi8/release/5)

What if the trade-off between top accuracy and interpretability was greatly exaggerated? This one is a brilliant plea to give transparent models a fighting chance.

> It is possible that an interpretable model can always be constructed, we just have not been trying.

### [Oscar Seasons: The Intersection of Data and the Academy Awards](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/6lpet0sx/release/3)

No big article stuck out in that issue for me, so I suggest this lighthearted yet solid meta-analysis of Oscar nominees' release timing!

### [Doing Data Science on the Shoulders of Giants: The Value of Open Source Software for the Data Science Community](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/xsrt4zs2/release/4)

A guided tour of open source solutions, of the few individuals carrying a good share of the work, and of the merits and flaws (yes, there are some) of the paradigm.

> Without these people and projects, data science as we know it could not exist.

###### Runner-up

[Toward Foundations for Data Science and Analytics: A Knowledge Framework for Professional Standards](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/6wx0qmkl/release/3)

### [The Importance of Being Causal](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/wjhth9tr/release/1)

An introduction to causal inference and how it's used in real business applications. Heavily recommended for anyone working with observational data (which, depending of where you work, probably represents between 95% and 100% of your whole data). Also, simply one of the most finely crafted introductory articles that I know of on any topic.

###### Runner-up

[Ten Research Challenge Areas in Data Science](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/d9j96ne4/release/2)

### [Selective Inference: The Silent Killer of Replicability](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/l39rpgyc/release/1)

A delightful read, that starts with a concise retrospective of the inter-related replication and p-value crises, two nail-biting scientific sagas with far-reaching consequences. The author elegantly argues that unattended selective inference is the elephant in the room in both cases, and consequently points out that many of the recent campaigns against statistical significance have been somewhat off-target, and that some major publications are perhaps worse off than they were before the onset of the crises. Drama, you say?


##### That's it! Happy reading!
