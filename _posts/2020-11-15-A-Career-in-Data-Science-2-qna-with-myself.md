As promised, here is part 2 of my personal reflexion/written practice for the career in data science virtual Q&A session that I'll be... answering I guess, in a few days. I must say, the question prompts provided to me were excellent and indeed prompted me to systematically cover all of the important career aspects I could think of. Enjoy!

**Disclaimer:** *The field is very diverse and opinions on it as well. What follows is the result of my personal, sometimes subjective, and certainly limited view of this immense domain. I myself may not agree with some of this a few years from now, as data science evolves along with my view of it. And I strongly encourage anyone to make my take on the topic not be the only one that they read.*

What is a typical career path? An atypical career path?
-------------------------------------------------------

To answer this correctly, I'll have to digress a bit on the required skills to thrive in the discipline.

### Parenthesis on the data scientist's skill set

Such a thing is not easy to determine. As just mentioned, the field is diverse, with people coming from various backgrounds. It's a challenge at times to have people with different paths and expertise working together, but it also contributes to the richness of the discipline, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Part of this diversity stems directly from the fact that data science has yet to find itself a precise technical definition.

Still, there are some core mathematical, statistical and programming notions that are considered essential for a career in the domain. This [article](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/6wx0qmkl/release/3) summaries them quite well, though I would consider a candidate checking about 70% of the list to be already very valuable.

Also, this Venn diagram, that originated [here](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram) as far as I can tell, is I think one of the best simple summary of the three pillars of any work in data science.

|:------------------------------------------------------------:|
| *I personally think that each double region is a danger zone (or at least a lost opportunity zone) in its own right* |

This view though has been increasingly challenged recently as ignoring an important dimension. Most actors in the field now recognize that a strong level of general soft skills is a key element also. This is often summarized as communication capabilities, but I'd argue that organization and teamwork skills, along with scientific curiosity are also a big part of it. Taking this into account, here's another delightful diagram integrating that fourth aspect (I'll link the original source if I can find it).

### Back to the actual question! Typical career paths

Now that we know what we're after, it should be pretty clear that a typical path would be one where you tackle the math, stats and programming early in your studies, and acquire specific domain knowledge during your first work experiences or graduate studies. As for the communication element, most of it comes with practice, so I'd just recommend to actively seek such practice opportunities throughout your studies and after. All of this being said, here is (at last) my rundown of the typical path:

-   **Undergraduate studies in computer science, statistics, engineering, or some mix of these.** There are now dedicated data science undergrad programs, but they are mostly just a mix of courses from these disciplines. I guess they work well since they essentially force you to have a broad exposition to all of the foundations, but you can do the same with any degree offering some flexibility.

-   **A graduate degree in one of these disciplines. Alternatively, it could be a degree in an applied field where you deliberately orient your course work and research towards using data science to solve a domain specific issue.** At this stage, a dedicated data science masters does make sense, and excellent programs are starting to pop-up everywhere. If you already know what you want to specialize into (computer vision, NLP, RL, forecasting), it's a good idea to do so at this point, but staying broad is also ok. At the master level at least, there's no such thing as a wrong specialization choice, as developing the DS mindset and perfecting the core skills is what really matter, and this is quite transferable from one sub-domain to another.

-   **A junior, temporary or internship position, possibly as part of a graduate program.** More on that in a later question.

-   **From there, sky is the limit!** You may decide to specialise and focus your work on a sub-field or keep improving your general knowledge of the discipline and soft skills to become a consultant or a project/team manager.

### Atypical paths

**An atypical path would be anything that does not start with a strong numeric foundation.** If you're serious about pursuing a data science career though, you will have to tackle the bases at some point. Still, even this might come to change. Now that auto-ml services are spawning left and right, and some machine learning tasks are essentially solved, who knows what the numerical proficiency threshold is going to be in the future. I can't decide right now if it's a good or a bad thing, but it certainly is a thing.

There are also positions that are a bit more peripheral (but increasingly important in any data science team/service) such as product manager and business translator, that require a good knowledge of how data science works, but no deep technical abilities. Likewise, the many social questions related to the applications of DS (transparency, fairness and privacy, just to name a few), will require the crucial input of individuals from the social sciences and humanities.

Are trainee programs and/or internships common?
-----------------------------------------------

**Undergraduate internships exist, but you will likely be doing mostly data base manipulations, dashboards and analytics, and not much science.** It does help in getting a good primer of SQL and hands-on knowledge of a typical big data ecosystem, but it's not the end of the world if you know little about this by the end of your studies. What really counts is your ability to learn these things quickly once you get out there, which will happen naturally if you developed a good foundation and sufficient autonomy. These traits are what recruiters are really looking for. Data teams are much more interested in what you can potentially do for them a year from now than in what you can do tomorrow.

**As for graduate interships or research partnerships, they are quite common and often quite profitable for both parties.** It can also lay the ground for a possible permanent position after your studies.

**Finally, many companies have rotation programs, time-limited contracts where a new employee will spend a fixed amount of time on a few projects.** Even if this does not always lead to a permanent position with the company afterwards, it's a great way to build experience and to be exposed to many different mandates, giving you a better idea of what you'd like to do on the longer term.

What are typical salary ranges for these positions?
---------------------------------------------------

With a masters degree, for an entry position in Montreal, you should get something between 60k and 80k dollars (Canadian) yearly with good additional perks. From there, it can rise rather quickly and reach 150k (perhaps more, I don't have much visibility on that higher end!) for senior positions in the big tech or finance sector.

Are there certain jobs for which a PhD is necessary/preferred?
--------------------------------------------------------------

**In most cases, it's not necessary, but often expected for positions with a strong R&D workload and/or with one of the big tech players.** However, I feel that the equivalent amount of time spent in the industry, with some serious R&D and active learning effort, is as relevant as a PhD and viewed as such by most recruiters (but some still view the PhD as a hard requirement).

Keep in mind also that in most data-driven workplaces, there are ample opportunities for doing academic level research. Personally, I read more articles and conduct more open-ended projects now than I did at any point during my studies.

**In the end, my personal advice would be this: If you decide to do a PhD, do it because you really want to, not just for some precise job objective.**

How does your graduate training help you do your work?
------------------------------------------------------

**It helps a lot, just not in the most obvious ways.** The most important part of my graduate degree was not the precise things I did or learned, though of course some notions of machine learning and a few applied projects did contribute greatly to my employability. What imported really was the experience acquired in long term projects, teamwork, autonomous learning, redaction and communication (the famous soft skills mentioned earlier).

Real work is nothing like an undergraduate homework or exam. The path to the correct answer (if there's even such a thing) is not always obvious. In fact, sometimes determining the question becomes the core of your task. You will have to manage expectations, team mates and stakeholders of varying technical proficiency. A good graduate degree will allow you to develop these skills in addition to sharpening your more technical capabilities.

Are freelance/consulting careers possible?
------------------------------------------

Yes, but I do not have much visibility on these career paths. I would expect the challenges to be the same as for most self-employed jobs: knowing how to start, making and keeping contacts, managing your schedule and so on.

What advice do you have for new graduates? Late bloomers?
---------------------------------------------------------

### New graduates

-   Getting the first opportunity is one of the tougher step. Getting in touch personally with the teams your are interested in might be a good way to stand out among the pile of candidates that apply to any DS position.
-   Some will encourage you to have an attractive online portfolio of your graduate projects, or to show off some specific extra-curricular project (such as your entry in a Kaggle contest). It certainly helps in showcasing your project building skill, but it can work both ways. So if you do it, give it your best shot, and choose a challenge that your are passionate about.

### Late bloomers

-   With a good numerical or programming foundation, transferring to a data science position is quite doable. I myself have witnessed a few successful conversions from programmers and analysts. My best advice would be to try to learn a bit more each day, and to find ways to incorporate data science in your day-to-day work.
-   If not, then I'd classify it as an atypical path and refer you to that earlier question.

From a hiring perspective, what positions are most difficult to fill?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

From the perspective of our own data and analytics team, I'd say the rarest catches are data engineers, the ones responsible for building and maintaining data pipelines. There are just not that many candidates for these less glamorous positions it seems. Depending on who you ask, they might or might not be considered data scientists. Regardless, know that if this is something that you're into, you will be in high demand.

**More generally, senior positions are very hard to fill.** It takes a lot of time to find a suitable candidate that is affordable. And then there's always the risk that they leave on their first day because Facebook just made them an offer (true story). Sometimes, it feels easier to invest in developing the team that you have. For this reason, companies will generally put effort in providing good growing opportunities for their data scientists.

What do you know now that you wish you had known when you first started?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some thoughts off the top of my head:

-   Having the perfect model/solution/algorithm is something you can rarely afford timewise in practice.
-   Solutions that a stakeholder can understand have a much better chance to be pushed forward.
-   Efficient communication with less technical colleagues is more important than you think.

What has failure taught you?
----------------------------

First of all, I would only qualify an endeavor as a total failure if I fail to learn anything out of it. Otherwise, a certain share of drawbacks, mistakes and wasted efforts are just part of any hard work, so the best is just to not linger on them, learn what you can and turn the page. Nevertheless, there are good habits that help to avoid or at least minimize the impact of failures. Here are two that apply to many situations.

1.  Start small: start with the simplest good solution to a problem, even if it's clearly not the best, it might just be sufficient. If not, use it as a benchmark to evaluate the next steps.
2.  Fail fast: test your solutions, seek feedback from peers and stakeholders, do it early and often.

How has Covid 19 impacted your industry? Your job?
--------------------------------------------------

Not that much I'd say. Like most, I am know often working from home and getting sick of online meetings. Still, I consider myself and my colleagues very lucky overall. In my office no one lost their job. If anything, as people turn more and more towards digital services of all kind, the demand for our kind of work has grown accordingly. I did hear though that some companies are reluctant to get new DS hires in these uncertain times.

Closing remarks
---------------

Thanks for reading! I'll just leave you with a few general closing remarks to wrap this up:

-   An early and solid grasp on maths, stats and programming will get you a long way.
-   Don't worry too much about mastering specific technologies before you need them, they might become obsolete soon enough.
-   DS won't lead us anywhere if we can't communicate its details, benefits and pitfalls to an non-scientific audience.
-   The most important aspect of DS (and also the most fun I think) is that you will have to actively keep learning new things and sharpen your skill set. The most promising data scientists that I know are those that are the most hungry in that sense.
