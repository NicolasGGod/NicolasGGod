I am a data scientist with a math and statistics background, currently working at Ubisoft in Montreal, Canada. I also have substantial musical antecedents, and still work once in a while as a freelance composer, arranger and orchestrator.

## Education

- M Sc in statistics (Montreal, 2018)
- B Sc in mathematics (Montreal, 2016)
- Bachelor of music, jazz performance (McGill, 2010)

## Specific data science expertises

- Statistical learning
- Simulations
- Skill rating and match making algorithms
- Disruptive behavior detection
- Problem specification and needs assessment
- Complex problem solving
- Advanced analytics

## Some links to music I've written

[An amazing recorder quartet](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5W9P0KN3iXbTsjRO00WgeZ) that I have the chance to work for.

[A crazy album by the unique Lulu Hughes](https://open.spotify.com/album/5sejULPhxDfzyyqcxJibSa) + a bunch of very fine musicians. 

[A Christmas album](https://open.spotify.com/album/5pVsoNNa9qft4DkwUwHYwg) for which we wrote the whole string parts in a week or so! Given the circumstances, I was leading a team of 3 arrangers + myself. I personaly wrote the first two arrangements, and did the final score edits on the remainder (though my 3 partners in crime made that last part quite easy).
