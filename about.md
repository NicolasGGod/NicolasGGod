I am a data scientist with a math and statistics background, currently working at Ubisoft in Montreal, Canada. I also have substantial musical antecedents, and still work once in a while as a freelance composer, arranger and orchestrator.

## Education

- M Sc in statistics (Montreal, 2018)
- B Sc in mathematics (Montreal, 2016)
- Bachelor of music, jazz performance (McGill, 2010)

## Specific data science expertises

- Statistical learning
- Problem specification and needs assessment
- Complex problem solving
- Advanced analytics
- Simulation
- Algorithm optimization
- Skill rating and match making algorithms
- Disruptive behavior detection
- Unsupervised learning of playstyle


## Some links to music I've written

[An amazing recorder quartet](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5W9P0KN3iXbTsjRO00WgeZ) that I have the chance to work for.

[A crazy album by the unique Lulu Hughes](https://open.spotify.com/album/5sejULPhxDfzyyqcxJibSa) + a bunch of very fine musicians. 

[A Christmas album](https://open.spotify.com/album/5pVsoNNa9qft4DkwUwHYwg) for which we wrote the whole string parts in a week or so! Given the circumstances, I was leading a team of 3 arrangers + myself. I personaly wrote the first two arrangements, and did the final score edits on the remainder (though my 3 partners in crime made that last part quite easy).


## Academic stuff

### Talks

###### Online skill rating algorithms (Joint Statistical Meeting, Denver CO, 08/2019)
###### On-line Partitioning of the Sample Space in the Regional Adaptive Algorithm (SSC annual meeting, Montréal QC, 06/2018)



###### Jeux vidéos et complexité / *Video games and complexity* (Club Math de l'Université de Montréal, 04/2018)

I used parts of [this delightful article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1895) proving the NP-hardness of classic video games as a pretext to introduce undergraduate science students to computational complexity theory. The talk (in french) is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97z25hJgbMg).

###### Méthodes de Monte-Carlo par Chaînes de Markov adaptatives / *Adaptive Markov Chain Monte-Carlo methods* (Séminaire des étudiants gradués, Montréal, 11/2017)

A presentation of the basics of adaptive MCMC (my master thesis topic) tailored to an audience of graduate mathematics students.

###### Quand le hasard fait bien les choses / *A matter of chance* (Club Math de l'Université de Montréal, 08/2015)

An introduction to the simulation of random variates, from uniform number generators to MCMC methods. 

###### La loi des petits nombres / *The law of small numbers* (Club Math de l'Université de Montréal, 07/2014)
